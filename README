Description:

Tracey is a free application whose purpose is to help with log file monitoring and analysis. It provides viewing and monitoring features 
for multiple files simultaneously, plus on the fly filtering. Tracy is not a text editor, but a log viewer, designed to handle very 
large files in an efficient way. For this reason, the editing features are disabled. This also helps preventing the accidental 
damaging of the original files.

While it is possible to load large files entirely into memory, this becomes unfeasable past several GBs, due to the high amount of memory 
needed and increased loading times. Tracy provides ways of opening only parts of the file, either by file position or line number, 
allowing working with very large files which cannot be opened with standard text editors.

Tracy provides filtering using logical operators, which can be combined with regular expressions or wildcards. This makes even the 
most complicated search conditions easy to create and understand.
